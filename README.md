## Plexical CocoaPod Packages

These are [CocoaPod](http://cocoapods.org/) packages that we use
in-house at [Plexical](http://www.plexical.com/) that have licences to
allow them to be shared with the public. Check individual
sub-directories for individual Pod's `LICENCE` file.

Instructions for in-house Pod repos taken from
[here](http://i.ndigo.com.br/2012/04/using-cocoapods-for-in-house-components/).
